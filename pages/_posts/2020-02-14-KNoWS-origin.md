The KNoWS (knowledge on web scale) team is a group of researchers and developers who are focused on leveraging the power of linked data event streams (LDES) to improve the way that information is organized and shared on the web. The team is led by Pieter Colpaert, who has been working in the field of linked data for many years and has a deep understanding of its potential to transform the way we interact with the web.

Linked data event streams (LDES) are a powerful tool that allows for the efficient replication and synchronization of collections of immutable events, described in linked data. This makes it possible to share and access large amounts of data in real-time, without the need for centralization or a single point of control.

The KNoWS team is using the TREE specification to publish LDES on the web, which provides a framework for using linked data to create efficient fragmentations and link pagination. This approach is more powerful and scalable than other methods, and has the potential to enable limitless growth and expansion of linked data on the web.

One of the key goals of the KNoWS team is to make it easier for people to access and use linked data on the web, and to develop tools and applications that can help people understand and make sense of the vast amounts of data that are available. The team is working on a number of projects and initiatives, including the development of new technologies and algorithms for processing and analyzing linked data, and the creation of user-friendly interfaces and visualization tools to help people explore and interact with linked data in meaningful ways.

Overall, the nascency of the KNoWS team is an exciting development in the world of linked data, and represents a significant step forward in our ability to make use of this valuable resource on the web. With Pieter Colpaert at the helm, the team is well positioned to continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible with linked data, and to help unlock its full potential for the benefit of people around the world.
