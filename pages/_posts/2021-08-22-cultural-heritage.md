In 2021, Brecht Van De Vyvere published a paper called "Publishing Cultural Heritage Collections of Ghent with Linked Data Event Streams" which discussed the first established use case of LDES. In this paper, Van De Vyvere discussed how LDES could be used to publish cultural heritage collections in the city of Ghent, Belgium.

The paper discussed the challenges that cultural heritage institutions face in maintaining and publishing their collections in a way that is both interoperable and reusable. In order to overcome these challenges, Van De Vyvere and his team applied Flemish Linked Data Standards (OSLO) to make the data within the Axiell Collections CMS interoperable. They then used the method of Linked Data Event Streams (LDES) to make the data reusable.

LDES is a new approach to publishing Linked Data that focuses on the creation and distribution of data streams. These data streams are continuous, real-time feeds of data that can be accessed and used by anyone with an internet connection. This approach is useful for a variety of applications, including publishing cultural heritage collections.

In the case of Ghent, LDES was used to publish a collection of over 200,000 cultural heritage objects. This collection included a wide range of items, including paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, and other artifacts. By publishing this collection using LDES, Van De Vyvere and his team were able to make the collection more accessible and discoverable to a wider audience.

The LDES approach was successful in making the cultural heritage collections in Ghent more interoperable and reusable. The data streams created using LDES were adopted by third parties, who used them to host subject pages, a SPARQL endpoint, and other tools. This demonstrates the potential of LDES to serve as the core Web API for a CMS, allowing third parties to take up other querying and processing tasks on their own machines.

Overall, the use case of LDES for publishing cultural heritage collections in Ghent demonstrates the potential of this approach for making large and complex datasets more accessible and useful. By making it possible to publish real-time, granular data about cultural heritage objects, LDES opens up new possibilities for research and exploration in this field.
