    <h3>The Linked Data Event Streams client</h3>
    <p>
      A Linked Data Event Stream is a <code>tree:Collection</code> with immutable members.
      You can use the client to replicate the full <code>tree:Collection</code> and remain in-sync with it afterwards by following all relations starting from a view.

    <h3>Bucketizers and connectors</h3>
    <p>
      Bucketizers categorize each member of a collection in one or more pages. Connectors write members to a back-end or to another stream processor.

    <h3>Querying tree:Collections with Comunica</h3>
    <p><a href="https://comunica.dev" target="_blank">Comunica</a>, a Web framework to query Linked Data Fragments and heterogeneous views on top of <code>tree:Collections</code>.</p>
    <p>
      At the moment of writing (dec 2021), TREE support in Comunica is still experimental.
      A working prototype can be found <a href="https://github.com/TREEcg/treemunica">in this fork</a>. It supports TREE and LDES metadata extraction, and is able to perform <a href="https://tree.linkeddatafragments.org/demo/autocompletion/?datasets%5B%5D=https%253A%252F%252Ftree.linkeddatafragments.org%252Fdata%252Faddressregister%252Fstreetnames%252F%252Chttps%253A%252F%252Fruben.verborgh.org%252Fprofile%252F%252Chttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.w3.org%252FPeople%252FBerners-Lee%252Fcard&query=Tim%2520B">autocompletion</a> across one or more <code>tree:Collection</code> that is fragmented using a substring fragmentation.
